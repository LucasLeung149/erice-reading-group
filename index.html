                        <h1>Reading Group on Weinberg's Cosmology</h1>
                        <h2>Trinity Term 2023</h2>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a reading group hosted by Prof Andre Lukas and his research group. The main text is Steven Weinberg's Cosmology and we are planning to 
                            go through most of the book with few omissions in between. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We meet every Fridays at 1000 in the Freeman Room in Beecroft during term time. Outside term time the meeting time may vary. If you wish to join 
                            you may contact Prof Andre Lukas at lukas@physics.ox.ac.uk.
                        </p>



                        <h2>Preliminary Schedule</h2>
                        <p>This is the preliminary schedule of the reading group. It will be updated as the term evolves. All quoted references are from Weinberg.</p>
                        <p>
                            There will be an assigned speaker/ leader per session. The speaker will be responsible for leading the discussion but they need
                            not understand all the material fully. Rather, they might choose to raise up questions to be discussed in the group. The other members
                            are expected to also read the relevant sections of the book and try and understand the material the best they can as well before they turn up
                            to the discussions as well!
                        </p>
