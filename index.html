                        <h1>Erice Reading Group</h1>
                        <h2>From Summer of 2025</h2>
                        <h2>Introduction</h2>
                        <p>
                            This is a reading group between Lucas and his amazing friends he made in Erice!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            We meet --- online via zoom. If you wish to join you may contact me at <a href="mailto:lucas.leung@physics.ox.ac.uk">lucas.leung@physics.ox.ac.uk</a>.
                        </p>



                        <h2>Preliminary Schedule</h2>
                        <p>This is the preliminary schedule of the reading group. It will be updated as the term evolves. All quoted references are from Weinberg.</p>
                        <p>
                            There will be an assigned speaker/ leader per session. The speaker will be responsible for leading the discussion but they need
                            not understand all the material fully. Rather, they might choose to raise up questions to be discussed in the group. The other members
                            are expected to also read the relevant sections of the book and try and understand the material the best they can as well before they turn up
                            to the discussions as well!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            There will also be a 15-minute discussion allocated to discussing new papers (could just be interesting or related to the discussion topic)
                            at the start of each session. The whole idea, really, is just to make it fun and stay in contact with every one with a bit of physics and mathematics...
                        </p>
